I decided to make this PokÃªdex app for a few reasons, I wanted to practice styling with SCSS and SASS which I just learned. I noticed a lot of job openings would mention knowledge of SASS as a great bonus, if not an outright requirement to know.

It solves quite a few problems, mainly having giant and unorganized CSS files. It also offers the nice bonus of being able to store CSS properties as variables. You can also use it in conjunction with several CSS frameworks.

SASS was created by Hampton Catlin, Natalie Weizenbaum, Chris Eppstein, and numerous contributors in 2006. It just recently migrated from using Ruby over to Dart. I think SASS is an incredibly helpful tool that I'll be using from now on to style my sites.

Here's a link to the SASS documentation, which I found is structered very well and is very clear and concise.
